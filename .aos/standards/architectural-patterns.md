# Architectural Patterns Template

This template provides standardized architectural patterns for building scalable applications.

## Core Processing Pipeline

### Multi-Stage Content Pipeline
Applications should center around a core content processing pipeline with these stages:

1. **Upload** - Handle file uploads to storage service
2. **Processing** - Transform/optimize content through processing services
3. **Status Tracking** - Granular status fields track each processing stage
4. **Output Generation** - Generate optimized versions and derivatives
5. **Delivery** - Serve processed content to consumers

### Status Pipeline States
- `uploading` - Content is being uploaded to storage
- `uploaded` - Upload complete, ready for processing
- `processing` - Content is being transformed/optimized
- `completed` - All processing finished successfully
- `failed` - Processing failed, requires intervention

## Database Schema Patterns

### Core Entity Relationships
Structure your data model around these fundamental entities:

- **Content Items** (primary entities)
- **Files** (raw uploaded content)
- **Metadata** (content-specific information)
- **Derivatives** (processed/optimized versions)
- **Collections** (grouping/organization)
- **Teams/Organizations** (ownership/collaboration)

### Relationship Guidelines
- Use foreign keys for clear relationships
- Implement proper cascading rules
- Consider soft deletes for user data
- Add audit trails for important changes

## Real-time Updates

### Subscription Patterns
Implement real-time features using:

- **Processing Status Updates** - Live progress feedback
- **Content List Changes** - Dynamic content updates
- **Collaborative Editing** - Multi-user coordination

### Implementation Strategy
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Implement optimistic updates for smooth UX
- Add conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Provide offline capabilities where possible

## Directory Structure Patterns

### API Routes Organization
```
/api/
  /v1/
    /content/         # Core content operations
    /collections/     # Organization/grouping
    /teams/          # Collaboration
    /media/          # Media proxy and utilities
    /dashboard/      # Dashboard-specific endpoints
```

### Frontend Components Structure
```
/components/
  /ui/              # Reusable UI components
  /content/         # Content-specific components
  /editor/          # Editing interface components
  /media/           # Media handling components
  /status/          # Status display components
```

### Data Layer Organization
```
/utils/
  /database/        # Database clients and utilities
  /storage/         # File storage utilities
  /*.types.ts       # Type definitions and schemas
```

## Type Safety Patterns

### Schema-First Development
- Define data schemas with validation libraries (Zod, Joi)
- Generate TypeScript types from schemas
- Use schemas for API validation
- Implement runtime type checking

### API Type Safety
- Use type-safe API frameworks (tRPC, GraphQL)
- Implement consistent error handling
- Version API responses with headers
- Validate input/output at boundaries

## State Management Patterns

### Client-Side State
- **Server State** - Use query libraries (React Query, SWR)
- **Client State** - Use lightweight stores (Zustand, Redux Toolkit)
- **UI State** - Use context providers for shared state

### State Organization
- Separate server state from client state
- Implement optimistic updates
- Add loading and error states
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Media Handling Patterns

### Upload Strategy
- Use pre-signed URLs for direct uploads
- Implement progress tracking
- Support resumable uploads for large files
- Add client-side validation

### Processing Pipeline
- Queue-based processing for scalability
- Multiple resolution/format outputs
- Thumbnail generation
- Metadata extraction

### Delivery Optimization
- CDN integration for global delivery
- Proxy endpoints for secure access
- Progressive loading strategies
- Format optimization (WebP, etc.)

## Authentication & Authorization

### Security Patterns
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Row-level security for data access
- API key management
- Session management with proper expiration

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Resource-level authorization
- Team-based access control
- Audit logging for security events

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from presentation
2. **Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error handling
3. **Performance First**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
4. **Security by Design**: Build security into every layer
5. **Scalability**: Design for growth from the beginning

## Adaptation Notes

When adapting these patterns:

1. **Domain Specificity**: Replace "content" with your domain entities
2. **Storage Needs**: Adapt file handling to your requirements
3. **Processing Requirements**: Customize pipeline stages for your use case
4. **Collaboration Features**: Implement team features as needed
5. **Integration Points**: Add external service integrations as required
